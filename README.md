This program hides the message in an image by LSB manipulation.

The image used here has dimension of: 1200x837 px, 3 color channels

This image is capable of storing 376,650 characters.

Practically we could use more than just the LSB to store the data, and increase the storage capacity as the difference in images is not visible to normal eye for few more bits manipulation.
